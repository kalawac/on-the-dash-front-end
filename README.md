*On the Dash* is a web-based data management and data analysis solution for people and organizations working on USAID-funded international development projects. It allows users to enter data offline using familiar and widely-accessible technology (CSVs) as well as online, directly into the database. Users can then receive immediate insight into project progress and potential gaps, through dashboard visualizations, as well as see numerical results using the standard USAID indicator reporting table format.

*On the Dash* is a capstone project made in fulfillment of Ada Developers Academy's graduation requirements and is licensed under the MIT License.
